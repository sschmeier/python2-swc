# Material for SWC python workshop

This is material that I collected from SWC's python2 material at [https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation-2.7](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation-2.7)

I created a this repo so that students can easily clone this, start a jupyter notebook, and are up and running without the overhead ov having all the other files SWC provides in their repo.

## Usage

```bash
# Change to Desktop and create directory
$ cd ~
$ cd Desktop
$ mkdir swc
$ cd swc 

# Clone the swc material 
$ git clone git@github.com:sschmeier/python2-swc.git
$ cd python2-swc

# start jupyter notebook
$ jupyter notebook
```

Click on the `New` button and select `Python` under  `Notebook`. You should be up and running!!!
